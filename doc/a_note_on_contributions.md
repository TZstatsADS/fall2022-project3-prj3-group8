Project 3 - group8: Image Predictive Analytics

Team members: Zhejing Shi, Jiapeng Xu, Yudan Zhang, John Podias

Summary: In this project, we built two image classification models that build upon the baseline logistic regression model that has very low accuracy. Our model 1 uses neural network methods and still has low accuracy of 20 percent due to the label noise. Our model 2 uses a similar model, but does label correction to improve accuracy. This final model gives us a 70 percent accuracy.

[Contribution Statement] in this project, Zhejing Shi & Jiapeng Xu mostly focus on coding model I & II. Yudan Zhang & John Podias are mainly responsible for organizing output & editing documents for presenting.
