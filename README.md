+ Project summary: In this project, we built two image classification models that build upon the baseline logistic regression model that has very low accuracy. Our model 1 uses neural network methods and still has low accuracy of 20 percent due to the label noise. Our model 2 uses a similar model, but does label correction to improve accuracy. This final model gives us a 70 percent accuracy.
